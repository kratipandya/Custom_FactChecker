historyLinguistics,p.~28,"Bickerton hypothesizes that language must have started with iconic labels \cite[p.~39]{historyLinguistics}.",Origins and Semiotic Shifts,"Bickerton also hypothesizes that language must have started with labels that were iconic"
historyLinguistics,p.~28,"Symbolic communication is then cast as a later development, increasing the distance between human and animal signaling systems \cite[p.~39]{historyLinguistics}.",Origins and Semiotic Shifts,"Symbolic communication would evolve later, making human language more different from animal means of communication"
historyLinguistics,p.~28,"That transition is credited with enabling what Hockett described as displacement, the ability to speak about entities beyond the here-and-now \cite[p.~39]{historyLinguistics}.",Origins and Semiotic Shifts,"Symbolism enabled what Hockett (1959) identified as *displacement* the ability to talk about entities and states of affairs that are not in the *hic et nunc* of interactions"
historyLinguistics,p.~27,"Against this backdrop, critics point out that syntactocentric models do not illuminate the evolutionary source of the lexicon \cite[p.~38]{historyLinguistics}.",Origins and Semiotic Shifts,"As pointed out by Jackendoff (2010: 69), an important problem with 'syntactocentrism' is that is does not account for 'the evolutionary source of the lexicon.'"
historyLinguistics,p.~23,"Chomsky's habitual equivocation between the terms ""mind"" and ""brain"" is argued to shed little light on the nature of universal grammar \cite[p.~34]{historyLinguistics}.",Cognitive Architectures,"Chomsky's usual equivocations with the disjunctive phrase 'mind/brain' has not been informative about the nature of UG"
historyLinguistics,p.~24,"While complementarity is acknowledged in language processing, current evidence does not show that neural regions are dedicated solely to linguistic tasks \cite[p.~35]{historyLinguistics}.",Cognitive Architectures,"While complementarity is also true in the case of language, it is not evident that the brain parts are specialized for language only"
historyLinguistics,p.~41,"The broader literature now frames language architecture as modular, an idea absent from earlier accounts \cite[p.~52]{historyLinguistics}.",Cognitive Architectures,"We also now think of the architecture of languages as modular. This is an idea that does not appear in the earlier literature"
historyLinguistics,p.~31,"From a pragmatic perspective, the language faculty appears adaptive only within a species that was not already capable of naive psychology \cite[p.~42]{historyLinguistics}.",Cognitive Architectures,"From a pragmatic perspective, it is quite clear that the language faculty and human languages, with their richness and flaws, are only adaptive in a species that is already capable of na*ve psychology"
historyLinguistics,p.~37,"Such arguments frequently invoke exaptation to emphasize how language may have scaffolded itself on pre-existing capacities \cite[p.~48]{historyLinguistics}.",Cognitive Architectures,"EXAPTATION has been a recurrent concept in the literature, underscoring the (self-) scaffolding aspect of language evolution"
historyLinguistics,p.~32,"It looks as though our hominin ancestors weighed the pros and cons of speech versus signing when selecting a dominant communicative technology \cite[p.~43]{historyLinguistics}.",Modalities and Physiology,"It appears to me that biology-style natural selection did drive the evolution of language conceived of as the cumulative manufacture of particular communicative technology under specific ecological pressures that favoured speech as its medium"
historyLinguistics,p.~33,"Speech may have offered an energy advantage because it relies on articulators smaller than those required for signing \cite[p.~44]{historyLinguistics}.",Modalities and Physiology,"Speech may be more energy-efficient, as it depends on articulators that are smaller than those involved in signing"
historyLinguistics,p.~35,"Lieberman links the resulting vocal tract reconfiguration, following the shift to bipedalism, to a maladaptive vulnerability to choking \cite[p.~46]{historyLinguistics}.",Modalities and Physiology,"According to Lieberman (1984, 2006), this otherwise maladaptive phenomenon (which puts humans at the risk of choking while ingesting) was probably a consequence of the reconfiguration of the basicranial structure after the hominins became bipedal"
historyLinguistics,p.~39,"The prevailing approach assumes that humans are not more evolved than non-human primates; they are simply different \cite[p.~50]{historyLinguistics}.",Comparative Perspectives,"there is a growing literature suggesting that differences between animals and humans are more a matter of degree than dichotomy"
historyLinguistics,p.~39,"Longstanding discussions maintain that animal communication systems are innate, whereas human communication must be learned \cite[p.~50]{historyLinguistics}.",Comparative Perspectives,"It has long been assumed that animal means of communication are innate but that of humans are not"
historyLinguistics,p.~39,"Even so, a growing body of work contends that differences between humans and other animals are matters of degree rather than categorical divides \cite[p.~50]{historyLinguistics}.",Comparative Perspectives,"Some of the capacities having to do with mirror neurons and mind-reading are very similar, which raises the question of whether human intelligence is not a consequence of the particular ways various parts of the brains and modules of the mind interact"
historyLinguistics,p.~36,"Chomsky has compared individual languages to viral species, with idiolects playing the role of organisms \cite[p.~47]{historyLinguistics}.",Scholarly Debates,"Mufwene has gone as far as to argue that individual languages are the counterparts of viral species, with their organisms being the idiolects of particular speakers/signers"
historyLinguistics,p.~36,"Researchers of language evolution do not share uniform assumptions, prompting questions about whether their inquiries converge on the same problems \cite[p.~47]{historyLinguistics}.",Scholarly Debates,"It should be obvious by now that students of the evolution of language do not share identical working assumptions. Nor have they focused on the same research questions"
historyLinguistics,p.~40,"Hombert and Lenclud observe that many contemporary stances echo positions already voiced by eighteenth-century philosophers \cite[p.~51]{historyLinguistics}.",Scholarly Debates,"Hombert and Lenclud (in press) note likewise that a number of the positions assumed today were already defended by philosophers of the eighteenth century"
historyLinguistics,p.~41,"Darwin's lasting impact is evident in the scholarly consensus that language is not a divine gift but a natural development \cite[p.~52]{historyLinguistics}.",Scholarly Debates,"Whether or not we acknowledge it, Charles Darwin has also exercised a long-lasting impact on us: most scholars today do not assume that language was God-given"
